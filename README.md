I'm a passionate and motivated learner from Marrakech, Morocco, currently building my skills in both Front-End Development and Data Analytics. I’m driven by curiosity and the desire to create smart, practical solutions—whether through interactive web interfaces or data-driven insights.

I'm currently learning:
💻 Front-End Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
📊 Data Analytics Tools: Excel, SQL, Python

I'm actively taking part in two professional programs with ALX:
Front-End Developer Program
Data Analytics Certificate

🛠️ So far, I’ve built a basic café management interface and a student grade management website, and I’ve participated in a national population statistics project in Morocco—an experience that gave me exposure to real-world data handling and teamwork.
🔍 My goal is to grow into a Front-End Developer and Data Analytics Specialist, combining design with data to build intelligent and user-focused digital solutions.
